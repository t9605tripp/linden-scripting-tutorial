# Getting Started with the Linden Scripting Language
## Introduction
This is an introduction to the Linden Scripting Language and how to use it on [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/). Second Life is a massive multiplayer online game that allows users to program elements of the game while in game! This allows users to create objects or scripts and then sell them on the [Second Life Marketplace](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/) for in-game currency called Linden Dollars (L$). Those Linden dollars can be exchanged for US Dollars (USD) and thus be a great way to both practice programming skills and make some money!


## Description of Materials (illustrated)
- [Viewer](#viewers)
- [Text editor (optional)](#text-editors)


## Code Example
This shows the basics of scripting, it should include the 
```
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSay(0, "Hello, Avatar!");
    }
 
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llSay(0, "Touched.");
    }
}
```
