# Getting Started with the Linden Scripting Language
## Introduction
This is an introduction to the [Linden Scripting Language](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/A_Basic_LSL_Tutorial) and how to use it on [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/). Second Life is a massive multiplayer online game that allows users to program elements of the game while in game! This allows users to create objects or scripts and then sell them on the [Second Life Marketplace](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/) for in-game currency called Linden Dollars (L$). Those Linden dollars can be exchanged for US Dollars (USD) and thus be a great way to both practice programming skills and make some money! This introduction assumes that you have minimal programming experience, with at least some knowledge about the keywords: *constants*, *events*, *flow control (i.e. if, while, return statements)*, *functions (also called methods)*, *operators*, *states*, *types*, *variables*, and *errors*

## Description of Materials (illustrated)
To start scripting on Second Life you will need a Viewer, that's it! You can optinally download a text editor to write in the Linden Scripting Language while offline.

- [Viewer](#viewers)
- [Text editor (optional)](#text-editors)


## Code Example
The best beginner coding examples can be found on the [Linden Scripting Language Wiki](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/A_Basic_LSL_Tutorial). This wiki is the definitive source for all of the Linden Scripting Language, and should be referenced as your comprehensive resource after this tutorial.

The following code is one of the most basic examples, and we will break it down 
```
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSay(0, "Hello, Avatar!");
    }
 
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llSay(0, "Touched.");
    }
}
```


## Installation instructions
### A Viewer is required to log in to SecondLife, choose either of these Viewers to get started with programming!
#### Viewers
- [Firestorm Viewer](https://www.firestormviewer.org/os/)
- [SecondLife Viewer](https://secondlife.com/support/downloads/)
### A text editor is helpful for scripting outside of SecondLife
#### Text Editors
- [LSLEditor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lsleditor/)
- [Notepad++ import](https://pastebin.com/maYqDNxT)
